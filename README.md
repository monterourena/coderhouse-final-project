# Coderhouse Web Development - Final Project
I am excited to present the final project of the Web Development course, coderhouse commission 36420! 

This project consisted of the creation of a web site using mostly Vanilla HTML and CSS. We have made the design fully responsive, incorporated elements from the popular Bootstrap framework, and utilized SASS as a powerful CSS preprocessor. The result is a polished, professional website that looks great on any device.
