# Coderhouse - 3rd Delivery of the Final Project
We are excited to present the third preliminary delivery of our final project of the Software Development course, coderhouse commission 36420! 

This project involved the creation of a stunning website using only HTML and CSS. In this latest update, we have made the design fully responsive, incorporated elements from the popular Bootstrap framework, and utilized SASS as a powerful CSS preprocessor. The result is a polished, professional website that looks great on any device. Stay tuned for the final version!
